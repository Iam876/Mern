    Debugging Node.js Applications:

    There are several ways to debug Node.js applications:
        1. Core Node.js Debugger:
            - Node.js comes with a built-in debugging utility. You can start it by running your script with the `node inspect` command.

        2. Node Inspector:
            - Use external tools like the Node Inspector for a browser-based debugging experience.

        3. Built-in Debugger in IDEs:
            - Most modern IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, WebStorm) have built-in debugging tools tailored for Node.js development.

    We will focus on using the Built-in Debugger in IDEs:
        -> Open your project in the IDE (e.g., VS Code).
        -> Select your program file and add breakpoints by clicking on the line numbers (a red dot will appear).
        -> Right-click the file and select "Start Debugging" or press the debugger shortcut (e.g., F5 in VS Code).
        -> Use the debugger controls to step through your code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.

    Debugging is an essential skill that helps identify and fix issues in your code effectively.
